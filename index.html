        <p>Sookie is an Australian Shepard Mix. He's currently 13 years old, and I adopted him when he was 7 years Old. His back legs are bit worn down, but he can still get around. He loves treats and walks, but he gets a little anxious when he see's anything. I think this might be the herding nature of his bread. Overall he's a great dog!</p>
        <P>Dog's are truly human's best friend. I would recomend anyone that can have a dog to go adopt a fluffy friend, but be forewarned if you do you will be addicted. Symptoms without a dog include; depression, loneliness, lack of unconditional love amongst many other things.</P>
